== Introduction

This brings additional support for the Neo4j Test Harness to the Driver starter:

* It brings in the correct dependencies
* It provides auto configuration for the Test Harness:
** If there's a `Neo4j` bean instance, it configures a corresponding `Driver` bean that uses it
** If the test harness is available and there's no `Neo4j` bean, it creates one and opens a `Driver` instance to it.

The module uses Neo4j 3.5.x Test Harness by default, so that the overall build of this project can stay on JDK 8. 
You can however replace the 3.5.x dependencies with the corresponding 4.0 one without further configuration to benefit from Neo4j 4.0.

[abstract]
--
A Spring Boot starter with automatic configuration for the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-java-driver[Neo4j Java Driver].
--

== Introduction

This starter provides a convenient way to configure all aspects of the Neo4j-Java-Driver from within a Spring Boot application.
It provides a single, managed Spring Bean of type `org.neo4j.driver.Driver`, configured to your needs.

The starter does not add any additional functionality on top of the driver, but only exposes the drivers configuration in a Spring friendly way.
However, it configures the driver to use https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J] logging by default.

The starter only supports the 4.0 line of the Neo4j Java Driver.
It is tested and developed against https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot {spring-boot_version}].

The starter supports Neo4j server mode only, that is: A connection against a Neo4j server over the Bolt protocol.

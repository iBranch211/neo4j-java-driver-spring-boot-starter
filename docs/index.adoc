This is the manual for the Spring Boot Starter for Neo4j's Java Driver (a.k.a. the Bolt Driver).
--

_Who should read this?_

This manual is written for:

* engineers setting up a Neo4j connection to a single Neo4j instance or a Neo4j cluster over the wire, without the need for object mapping
* engineers who want to use Neo4j-OGM inside Spring Boot but needs access to the configuration options of the underlying Bolt driver.

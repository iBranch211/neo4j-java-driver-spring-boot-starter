|+++Flag, if leaked sessions logging is enabled.+++

|`{config_prefix}.config.logging-class`
|`org.neo4j.driver.internal.logging.Slf4jLogging`
|+++Used to configure a different Neo4j-Java-Driver logging implementation.+++

|`{config_prefix}.config.driver-logging-level`
|`java.util.logging.Level.WARNING`
|+++Log level for the bolt driver. This has only meaning of a Logging implementation other than Slf4jLogging has been chosen.+++

|`{config_prefix}.config.max-connection-lifetime`
|`1h`

|`{config_prefix}.uris`
|
|+++This is a fallback for usecases when multiple uris have to provided to get into a Neo4j cluster. Usually one logical entry point is recommended (through DNS or a loadbalancer for example).+++

|`{config_prefix}.metrics-enabled`
|`false`
|+++Set this to true, so that the driver collects metrics, which can be exported to Micrometer.+++

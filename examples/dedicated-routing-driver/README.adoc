= Dedicated routing driver

Usually, a Neo4j cluster should be identified by one logical `neo4j://` URL.
This can be a load balancer, a DNS resolver, anything that turns the URL into a clusters entry point.
There are however edge cases in which this is not feasible and you might want to pass multiple, physical `neo4j://` URLs to the driver.

We don't offer a dedicated configuration flag for that.
The solution here is to define your own Driver-bean, but you can reuse our `Neo4jDriverProperties` that saves you from manually reading configuration properties.

The configuration is stored in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
include::src/main/resources/application.properties[tags=custom-config]
----

To use the custom URIs, add a configuration class like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::src/main/java/org/neo4j/doc/driver/springframework/boot/dedicated_routing_driver/RoutingDriverConfiguration.java[tags=custom-config]
----
<1> Map your custom property with `@Value` onto a list of Strings or URIs.
<2> Let our machinery inject `Neo4jDriverProperties`, that includes all of our properties
<3> Use the convenience methods to create `org.neo4j.driver.AuthToken` and `org.neo4j.driver.Config` as needed.
<4> Call the dedicated `routingDriver` method

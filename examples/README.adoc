= Examples
:sectanchors:

We provide several examples how to use this starter.
The reactive demo can only be used with Neo4j version 4.

The examples use the "Movie" data set, that you can install into your instance by going to the http://localhost:7474/browser/?cmd=play&arg=movies[Neo4j Browser].
Enter the command `:play movies` and follow the instructions.

The examples expect an instance with the username `neo4j` and the password `secret`.

All examples use Maven, however they work completely the same with Gradle.

Also, all examples follow Spring Boot conventions, especially:
Use the dependency management and starters, don't provide dependencies for things that are available as a starter.
Use version properties for overwriting any managed version instead of an explicit version.

The examples all have the default main application class, that looks like this:

[source,java]
.A standard Spring Boot main application class
----
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class SimpleApplication {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(SimpleApplication.class, args);
	}
}

== Simple example

This examples uses the starter and configures username and password.
The provided driver bean is than used in a `CommandLineRunner` to retrieve movies in an imperative way:

[source,java]
[[simple-example]]
.DisplayMoviesComponent.java
----
include::src/main/java/org/neo4j/doc/driver/springframework/boot/simple/DisplayMoviesComponent.java[tags=simple-example,indent=0]
----

The main takeaway here is that the driver can be injected like any other bean.
It is a long living object that provides short living sessions.
The driver does not need to be closed, that is done automatically when the application shuts down.

The configuration is stored in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
org.neo4j.driver.uri=bolt://localhost:7687
org.neo4j.driver.authentication.username=neo4j
org.neo4j.driver.authentication.password=secret
----
